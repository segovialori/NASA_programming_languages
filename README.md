## Project Description
For this project, I will be scraping data from NASA GitHub repository README files. The goal will be to build a model that can predict what programming language a repository is, given the text of the README file.

## Goals
1. Predict the programming language of each repository
## Background
Github displays the programming languages used on the right side of each repository, showing all languages used and the percentage of the repo in each language.  The languages Github tracks are vast and include languages such as JavaScript, Python, Java, TypeScript, C#, PhP, C++, C, Shell, Ruby, etc. For this project, I will predict the most used language for each repository using the README files from NASA's Github repositories.
## Deliverables
1. A well-documented jupyter notebook that contains your analysis
2. One or two google slides suitable for a general audience that summarize your findings. Include a well-labelled visualization in your slides.
